## Background Context
You have been given 2 additional servers:
* gc-[STUDENT_ID]-web-02-XXXXXXXXXX
* gc-[STUDENT_ID]-lb-01-XXXXXXXXXX
Letâ€™s improve our web stack so that there is [redundancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering)) for our web servers. We want to add a second web server so that we can take off one of our servers for maintenance without affecting our users.
