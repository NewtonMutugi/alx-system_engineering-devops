## Background Context

“You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure” is a famous saying in the Tech industry. In the age of the data-ism, monitoring how our Software systems are doing is an important thing. In this project, we will implement one of many tools to measure what is going on our servers.

Web stack monitoring can be broken down into 2 categories:

- Application monitoring: getting data about your running software and making sure it is behaving as expected
- Server monitoring: getting data about your virtual or physical server and making sure they are not overloaded (could be CPU, memory, disk or network overload)

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/), **without the help of Google**:

### General
